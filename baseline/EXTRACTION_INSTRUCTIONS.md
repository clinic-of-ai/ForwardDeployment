## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Open The Coding Train Website**

2. Click the **"Console"** tab in DevTools

### **Step 3: Run the Extraction Script**

2. **Copy the entire contents** of that file
3. **Paste** into the Chrome DevTools Console
4. Press **Enter**

### **Step 4: Copy Results**

The script will automatically copy data to your clipboard. You'll see:

```
✅ EXTRACTION DATA COPIED TO CLIPBOARD!
📋 Paste this into a text file and share with your assistant
```

### **Step 5: Save the Data**

1. Open Notepad or VS Code
2. Create new file: `extracted-data.json`
3. **Paste** the clipboard contents
4. Save to: `C:\Users\phili\Documents\Coding\Replica\baseline\extracted-data.json`

### **Step 6: Extract Full HTML**

In the same Console, run this separate command:

```javascript
copy(document.documentElement.outerHTML)
```

Then:
1. Create new file: `extracted-html.txt`
2. **Paste** the HTML
3. Save to: `C:\Users\phili\Documents\Coding\Replica\baseline\extracted-html.txt`

## 📤 Share With Assistant

Once you have these files:
- `extracted-data.json`
- `extracted-html.txt` (first 200 lines is enough)
- `original-fullpage.png`

**Option A:** Share the file contents in chat (read with Cursor)

**Option B:** Let me read them directly:
```
Read and analyze:
- C:\Users\phili\Documents\Coding\Replica\baseline\extracted-data.json
- C:\Users\phili\Documents\Coding\Replica\baseline\extracted-html.txt (first 200 lines)
```

## ✅ What I'll Do Next

After you share the data, I will:

1. ✅ Analyze the exact HTML structure
2. ✅ Extract all CSS stylesheets and download them
3. ✅ Identify all design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
4. ✅ Update our replica HTML/CSS with precise data
5. ✅ Download and optimize all images/assets
6. ✅ Test responsive behavior
7. ✅ Refine until 95%+ visual match

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Nothing happens when I paste"
- **Fix:** Make sure you're in the **Console** tab, not Elements or Network

**Issue:** "Script errors"
- **Fix:** Make sure you copied the ENTIRE script from extraction-script.js

**Issue:** "Clipboard not working"
- **Fix:** Manually copy the console output (right-click → Copy object)

**Issue:** "Wrong website data"
- **Fix:** Double-check the URL bar shows `thecodingtrain.com`, not Chrome Help
